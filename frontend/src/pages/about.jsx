      Originally from Hong Kong🇭🇰, I moved to Taiwan🇹🇼 since my university years
      and am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering at National
      Taiwan University. My enthusiasm for coding has driven me to engage in a
      variety of projects, covering areas such as Unity, website development,
      Raspberry Pi, and blockchain technologies. In addition to my academic and
      coding endeavors, I have explored other interests by joining the AK Poker
      Club🃏 and Japanese Mahjong Club🀄️, reflecting my curiosity and eagerness
      to immerse myself in different cultures and activities.
